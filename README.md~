All files related to the same song should have same name, but ehm, different extensions. For this reason, this particular set-up cannot have more than one picture file per song. There is a browser audio compatibility issue between mp3 and ogg in HTML5. Should the user be instructed to create a copy of the playlist in the other format? It it'salot confusing too? 

Procedure:
User puts playlist in a folder.
Tagg them correctly adds albumart, making sure everything is fine.
Exports to HTML5.
Kid3 create a folder in user location with %{artist}-%{album}
for each:
 - id3 picture: export image file
 - 

%{filename}.&{extension}

if only one audio file with %{filename} is found:
> <audio>
>  <source src="%{filename}.%{extension}" type="%{codec}" />
>  <h1>Your browser isn't ready for so much hotness. Use the <a href="%{filename}.%{extension}">download-link</a> instead.</h1>.
>
> </audio>

if 2 audio files with the same %{filename} are found:
> <audio>
>  <source src="%{filename}.%{extension}" type="%{codec}" />
>  <source src="%{filename}.%{extension}" type="%{codec}" />
>  <h1>Your browser isn't ready for so much hotness. Use the <a href="%{filename}.%{extension}">OGG download-link</a> instead.</h1>.
>
> </audio>

I still hesitate. Perhaps its easier to make kid3 spit jekyll posts to provide custom layouts?

At this point the render version works, tho it's missing the JSON-LD part. Assuming that kid3 can be aware of a context for the next/previous system to work, this could be a cool feature. Maybe create 3 preset styles? I will present this, and see whats possible. Crossfingers. Worstcase scenario: i have jekyll music CMS module waiting to be filled by post created with kid3.... :)

2015/06/01 gah playnext bug fixd. Thoughts: rendering a folder buildable by jekyll is the only way to provide full freedom on the layout. Because this feature gives the desire to tweak the layout..
