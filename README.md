# kid3HTML5
To export a deployable website jukebox served with static HTML5-files by simply tagging your mp3 correctly, using kid3. http://kid3.sourceforge.net/

The Render folder contains a view of how an export would be rendered by kid3, assuming kid3 can create an image file for trackart and keep track of a next/previous track context.

I still hesitate. Perhaps its easier to make kid3 spit jekyll posts to provide custom layouts?

At this point the render version works, tho it's missing the JSON-LD part. Assuming that kid3 can be aware of a context for the next/previous system to work, this could be a cool feature. Maybe create 3 preset styles? I will present this, and see whats possible. Crossfingers. Worstcase scenario: i have jekyll music CMS module waiting to be filled by post created with kid3.... :)
